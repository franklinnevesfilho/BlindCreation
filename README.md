# Vertilux Tube Deflection calculator

This is a simple calculator to determine the deflection of a Vertilux tube based on the load applied to it.
You input the shades dimensions, and the fabric you wish to use.

The tube deflection is then calculated with 4 of the Vertilux's bottomrails, along with a maximum deflection limit shown in every graph.
